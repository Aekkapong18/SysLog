# SysLog

This is a simple application that records various log types, and compresses them, currently as a tar file.  
The logs are saved under the primary external storage folders named by the date and time.  

Some plans for improvement:
* Figure out when log files are done being written.

Done:
* Readme/About dialog
* Switch to Zip compression


### Note about Root Access:
It may not be possible to get the logs without root access. To be investigated later.
