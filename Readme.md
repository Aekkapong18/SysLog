# SysLog

This is a simple application that records various log types, and compresses them, currently as a tar file.  
The logs are saved under the primary external storage folders named by the date and time.  

Some plans for improvement:
* Options for tar/zip - Need to do the zip implementation in Java. May stop using tar completely

DoneL
* Readme/About dialog


### Note about Root Access:
It may not be possible to get the logs without root access. To be investigated later.
