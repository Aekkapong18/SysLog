The live logcat view will show you the current logcat output from your device. <br />
It will take <b>15-30 seconds</b> for the buffer to fill before it will catch up to the most recent events.
 The most recent lines may appear to be cut off due to buffering.
<br /><br />
You can stop and restart the output with the buttons in the action bar.
