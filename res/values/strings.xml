    <string name="information">This is a simple application that takes the system logs via dmesg and logcat,
and saves them to the primary external storage under SysLog/&lt;Date-Time&gt;, compresses them, and lets you upload/email them.
\nRoot access is required for 4.1+ to access the full logs, and in some cases for kernel logs.
