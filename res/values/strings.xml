    <string name="information">This is a simple application that takes the system logs via dmesg and logcat,
and saves them to the primary external storage under SysLog/{Date-Time}, compresses them, and lets you upload/email them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Root access is &lt;b&gt;required&lt;/b&gt; for 4.1+ to access the full logs, and in some cases for kernel logs.
